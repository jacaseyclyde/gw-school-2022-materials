# Holodeck Tutorial ReadMe

The holodeck repository can be found on [github at nanograv/holodeck](https://github.com/nanograv/holodeck).  There is also a [ReadTheDocs](https://holodeck-gw.readthedocs.io) with additional documention, installation instructions, etc.

The notebooks used during this PTA summer program can be found in the [`holodeck/notebooks`](https://github.com/nanograv/holodeck/tree/main/notebooks) directory.  We went through the [`discrete_illustris.ipynb`](https://github.com/nanograv/holodeck/blob/main/notebooks/discrete_illustris.ipynb) notebook together, and the attendees were asked to go through the [`semi-analytic-models.ipynb`](https://github.com/nanograv/holodeck/blob/main/notebooks/semi-analytic-models.ipynb) notebook.

Please feel free to share any comments, bugs, suggestions, or new applications of `holodeck`!
